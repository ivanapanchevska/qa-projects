# Java Tasks

Part of my study program was to excercise Java Programming Language. 
During the course I have learned basic OOP concepts in Java (Operators, Methods and Constructors, Classes and Objects, Inheritance and Polymorphism, Java Conditions and Loops).

In this final exam, main task was try inheritance and how to override methods in term to change direction of subclasses methods.
